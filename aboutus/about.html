                <div class="story">
                    <p>AdermI was born out of a shared vision to make skin health accessible and empowering for everyone. The inspiration came from a personal realization of how challenging it can be to accurately assess skin conditions without professional guidance. For many, the journey to proper diagnosis is filled with uncertainty, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatments. This hit home for our team, as we saw friends and family members struggle with skin issues, often left wondering whether they were facing something serious or easily treatable.</p>
                    <br/> 
                    <p>
                        The pivotal moment came when our AI/Computer Vision Specialist, Narmin Mammadova, was researching the potential of AI in healthcare. She realized that while AI had made significant strides in many fields, there was still untapped potential in personal skin health. With a background in computer vision and machine learning, she saw an opportunity to build a tool that could offer preliminary skin assessments using AIâ€”helping people get insights faster and encouraging them to take the next steps in their healthcare journey.
